# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analyze effectiveness of how different Kickstarter fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose

Provide Louise with additional information on how to maximize donations and the best time in which to try and accomplish those goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to complete the analysis for Louise there were several factors considered. First we wanted to determine outcomes of theater related campaigns at certain times of the year. Secondly we looked at how successful those campaigns were based on the amount of each goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data available for different Kickstarter campaigns. I first looked to compare periods of time to the most successful campaigns. In order to do so I looked at the launch date of each campaign and filtered the data to include only the theater category. I looked at what was considered succesful campaigns which met their fundraising goals, failed campaigns which missed their overall goal, and canceled campaigns. The data clearly showed that May and June had a higher probability of meeting their campaign goals.

This data is limited and runs through the first couple months in 2017. Also when comparing to the most recent year some of the same concludsions made do not hold true on the timing. For example in 2016 March - May were the most succesful outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next the outcomes based on overall goal achievement was analyzed. For this analysis each campaign was placed into a category based on the overall goal amount and then looked at the number of campaigns which met the goal or not. The highest percentage of successful campaigns were found in the under $1,000 and $1,000 to $4,999 caqtegory. As demonstrated in the graph seen here once the campaign goal exceeded $20,000 there were normally more failed then succesful campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some of the challenges in looking at this data was determining just the best data to use in answering the questions of what made for a successful campaign. While meeting the overall goal is great how many people actually dontated to the campaign should be considered along with the time a campaign was ran for. There were also lots of different categories in which the campaigns were centered around and many of them were not great representatives of just what the client was looking for. 

## Results

-   What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Based on the data I conclude that May and June of any given year provide for the highest number of succesful campaigns with over 50% meetign their campaign goals. 
2. Campaigns started in the Month of December tend to have the highest probability of not succeeding. 

-   What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The highest number of successful campaigns range in the $1,000 to $4,999 range. 

-   What are some limitations of this dataset?
Much of the data that was provided had to be manipulated in one way or anther to be able to succesfully analyze it. While this was doable it left out     some information that could have been helpful such as the reason the funds were being used.

-   What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Additional tables and graphs that could be used would be one that compares the number of days the campaigns were open for in comparison to the amount     raised.

Throughtout this analysis I was able to compare succesful kisckstarter campaigns related to funding for theater productions. I analyzed both the length of time a campaign ran for and timing of the year to find out when the most succesful campaigns ran. As demonstrated below you will see that most successful campaigns were ran in the April through June timeframe.
